# General

#### About CRYENGINE

CRYENGINE is the first all-in-one development solution with truly scalable computation and benchmark graphics technologies. With CRYENGINE, developers are fully equipped to create standout game experiences, using the engine behind games like [Ryse: Son of Rome](http://www.crytek.com/games/ryse/overview), [Robinson: The Journey](http://www.robinsonthegame.com/), [The Climb](http://www.theclimbgame.com/), Crytek’s latest release [Hunt: Showdown](https://www.huntshowdown.com/), and the [Crysis series](http://www.crytek.com/games/crysis3/overview).

The famous CRYENGINE Sandbox editor is a production proven, third-generation, real-time tool suite designed and built by AAA developers. All development features of a CRYENGINE game can be produced, edited and played immediately with the “what you see is what you play” (WYSIWYP) system. The engine can handle the instant conversion and optimization of assets in real-time, enabling cross-platform changes to all elements of the game creation process. This increases the speed and quality of development, while significantly reducing the risk of creating multi-platform games.

The most powerful game development platform is now available to everyone.

# Licensing

#### How much do I have to pay for CRYENGINE?

All of CRYENGINE, including the full engine source code, is available under our royalty based model. Please read the terms for more information.

#### What is the royalty fee?

5% Royalty - Your first 5K € / $ of annual revenue per project is royalty free.

#### How are the royalties calculated?

Royalties are calculated “at source”. That means: irrespective of whether you (as self-publishers) or a third party (publisher, platform owner etc.) receives the Gross Receipts you always have to pay Royalties based on the gross receipts without any deductions. By way of example: If your publishers receives gross receipts of USD 100,000.00, and you only get forwarded 70%, you still have to pay USD 5,000.00 as royalty.

#### Are there any exceptions from royalty payments?

In the following cases __*only*__, no royalties apply:

- On the first USD 5,000.00 of gross receipts per year and per game;
- Pure service and work-for-hire compensation without any share in gross receipts;
- Gross receipts you make on Crytek’s CRYENGINE Marketplace;
- Gross receipts from game derived merchandise which does not use CRYENGINE;
- Awards (from third parties which are not publishers of the game) granted for the game;
- Donations that are not used for developing the game;
- If royalties from your publisher are set off against advances/minimum guarantees, or if you have already paid royalties on such advances/minimum guarantees. In other words: you do not have to pay twice.

#### I started my project under the old Pay What You Want model. Do I have to change to the new royalty-based model?

If you started your project with an older version of CRYENGINE V, before CRYENGINE 5.5 and Editor source code was introduced, you can opt out of royalties for that project. You can't upgrade that particular project to CRYENGINE 5.5 or higher, though please get in touch with us and register your project __*before June 30th 2018*__ to continue working under the old Pay What You Want terms. After this date any project developed with any version of CRYENGINE V will be subject to royalties.

#### How do I register my CRYENGINE project to be exempt from royalties?

Please send an email to [release@cryengine.com](mailto:release@cryengine.com) and provide the following information:

- Your full, legal name.
- Your email address.
- Your username on cryengine.com services.
- The name of your project / game.
- Some additional info about your game, the status and engine version used.

You can only register one project. If you want to register another project, we will decide on a case-by-case basis. For example, if you are working for a studio that develops with CRYENGINE and register your game under your name, but you have a private project on the side, please get in touch, and we will evaluate the situation. 

#### Where do I have to send the royalty statements?

Please send your royalty reports to [release@cryengine.com](mailto:release@cryengine.com)

Detailed royalty statements (including without limitation: units sold per country, cancellations, refunds, chargebacks, etc.) are due thirty days after the end of every calendar quarter. The first royalty statement is due thirty days after the end of the quarter in which the general release of the game occurs.

#### Do I have to register my game with Crytek?

Yes. If a licensee plans to commercially exploit a game, the licensee shall give notice to Crytek three months prior to the approximate commercial release date of that game via email to release@cryengine.com. Crytek in its sole discretion may promote a licensee's game via Crytek's websites and/or social media channels subject to Licensee's approval of such promotion and Crytek’s discretion.

#### What about non-commercial and educational purposes?

If you are a student or a member of an academic institution you are in addition entitled to develop games and Serious games in accordance with the License Terms using CRYENGINE and to render such games in object code form (including the CRYENGINE Assets and the CRYENGINE Redistributables) pursuant to the CRYENGINE documentation. However, the student is in no case entitled to commercially exploit such games without Crytek's explicit prior written approval. In case the student wants to monetize the game the student needs to email [contact@cryengine.com](mailto:contact@cryengine.com). Monetization will be subject to Crytek's sole discretion. Please read the terms for more details about restrictions on use.

#### Does the CRYENGINE include the entire C++ source code?

Yes, CRYENGINE comes with the full source code. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE).

#### I would like to develop for PlayStation/Xbox. How do I get the console packages?

In order to get console packages, you need to be a Sony PlayStation or Microsoft Xbox verified developer. Please send your verification documents to [contact@cryengine.com](mailto:contact@cryengine.com). Once approved by us, you will be notified and your account will be activated to download the consoles packages.

#### Do I have to advertise CRYENGINE when I publish my game or any development material?

Yes, there are some requirements that specify how CRYENGINE needs to be referenced in your projects and accompanying marketing material. You can find the full list in our license agreement under point 3, but here’s a summary of the most important things:

- The CRYENGINE logo should be clearly visible in your credits, the beginning of the game, and major marketing material.
- The CRYENGINE logo should be displayed in the same manner as other third-party-partners’ logos.
- The following copyright message should be included in the final game, any demos, and trailers:
  - “Portions of this software are included under license © 2004-201_ Crytek GmbH. All rights reserved.”
- If you publish your game on Steam or other publishing platforms, mention that CRYENGINE is the engine / technology it was developed with.

You can find all legitimate variations of the CRYENGINE logo and our animated bumper for videos in our [asset bank, here](http://assets.crytek.com/asset-bank/action/browseItems?categoryId=152&categoryTypeId=1).

#### Can you help me with the marketing for my game?

There are several ways in which we can help our indie developers and licensees to promote their games. If you want us to help, the best way to apply for a spot is to promote your game in a [Showcase Gallery](https://forum.cryengine.com/viewforum.php?f=43) thread on the forums and adhere to the [Branding Guidelines](https://forum.cryengine.com/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=7) with all your marketing material.

Contact the community team at [crydev@crytek.com](mailto:crydev@crytek.com) if you are having further questions.

#### Can I create videos or streams using CRYENGINE and use them to generate YouTube ad revenue/Twitch donations etc.?

Absolutely, yes! We encourage you to create video content using CRYENGINE, and you can generate revenue through YouTube ads and Twitch donations without paying any royalties to us. For further reference, please refer to the Crytek video policy: [www.crytek.com/video-policy](http://www.crytek.com/video-policy) or contact the Community Team at [crydev@crytek.com](mailto:crydev@crytek.com) – we are happy to engage with influencers and find mutually beneficial ways to support each other.

#### What support resources are available?

# Certification

#### Where can I take a certification exam?

Rather than forcing you to travel to any particular location, our exams are proctored electronically, so you can take your test from any computer that has a good internet connection, an up-to-date web browser, and a web camera. Your test proctor will also need for you to prove to them that your test room is secure, that you are alone and unaided by outside resources or human helpers.

#### Will I be able to consult my notes, the documentation, or other resources to help me on the exam?

No. We want to test your knowledge, not your ability to find answers you don’t already know. During the exam, you will need to rely entirely on your memory and ability to analyze the question and select the correct answer. 

#### How long is a certification valid?

Certifications never expire, but they are specific to the version of CRYENGINE on which you were tested. The first exams are on version 5.5. For each subsequent version, a new set of questions and a separate set of exams will be issued to reflect changes in the software. Thus you should consider what version of the software you are likely to use, or which version your employer or prospective employer is using when choosing an exam version. 

#### Is there a certification for C# Programmers?

Not yet, but one is being developed.

#### Do I actually have to write code for the programming exams?

No, but you will have to correctly identify bugs and choose the correct answer from multiple examples of pre-written code. Most importantly, you’ll need to be familiar with the CRYENGINE API. Since real-world programmers use products like Visual Studio that provide dynamic access to functions and parameters and save them from having to memorize an entire library, the nature of the test questions reflects a similar environment.

#### Will you be issuing certification exams for versions of CRYENGINE older than 5.5?

There are no plans to do so at this time, although you are always welcome to send us your suggestions and requests to help us understand your needs.

# Marketplace Vendor

#### How do I become a vendor?

Once you have created a CRYENGINE account, you can become a vendor by going through the vendor sign-up process.

#### Who can become a vendor?

Anyone who resides in the countries that are supported by our payment provider can become a vendor for the CRYENGINE Marketplace. Please visit [this link](https://stage.cryengine.com/faq#faqc-payout) for further details.

#### Where can I find the asset submission guidelines?

You can find the asset submission guidelines [here](https://www.cryengine.com/asset-submission).

#### What is the revenue split between Crytek and Marketplace vendors?

The revenue split shows you the percentage of sales revenue that you receive versus the percentage that Crytek charges as a Marketplace fee. When you read “70/30”, this means that you receive 70% of the sales revenue while Crytek receives 30% of the sales revenue as a Marketplace fee. Crytek will send you an invoice in relation to Marketplace fees.

#### When will I be paid?

Whenever the monthly combined payment due to you exceeds $100, you will be paid on the 15th calendar day of the following month.

#### How will I be paid?

You will be paid via electronic fund transfer. Please note that in some countries your bank may charge an additional fee for the transfer. Please visit this page for a list of currently [supported countries](https://stage.cryengine.com/faq#faqc-payout).

#### What are my rights after agreeing to have my assets sold on the Marketplace?

By agreeing to have your asset sold on the Marketplace, you're granting Crytek a non-exclusive right to distribute your asset via the Marketplace and use it for marketing purposes. That means: We might use pictures or videos you upload to advertise the marketplace or advertise your items in a [vendor spotlight](https://www.cryengine.com/news/marketplace-spotlight-check-out-the-free-media-plugins-you-need) that can also be shared on secondary platforms like Facebook and Twitter. We will never claim your work to be ours and are happy to link to your social profiles if you decided to list them, publicly. Your work still belongs to you, and you retain ownership over it. You can freely redistribute it through other channels such as other online stores, or directly to users.

#### Can users modify, resell, or transfer content once they purchase it?

Users that have downloaded your content from CRYENGINE Marketplace are free to modify it. All items sold are non-transferable, and users cannot sub-license the asset for further distribution, regardless of whether they have modified it or not. Users cannot buy your asset and then distribute it to other developers to use in other projects, for example by listing it on the Marketplace or another store.

#### Are there any circumstances under which assets would be removed from the Marketplace?

There are some reasons why your assets may be removed from the Marketplace. These reasons include but aren’t limited to the following:

- Intellectual property dispute such as potential copyright infringement
- User complaints
- Lack of public interest in the items
- Malware
- Negative impact to the CRYENGINE or CRYENGINE Marketplace experience

If any of your items is taken down from the CRYENGINE Marketplace, we will notify you. Don’t hesitate to contact us at [marketplace@cryengine.com](mailto:marketplace@cryengine.com) for further information.

#### How are prices set?

When you submit your asset to the Marketplace, you set its basic price in US Dollars, Euro or GBP. International retail prices will be calculated automatically by converting the basic price into other currencies, potentially adjusting for local sales taxes and VAT, and rounding or otherwise adjusting on local pricing practices.

Try to set reasonable prices by considering the amount of work that went into the item but also its value for a game, and keep in mind that assets with source files are generally more valuable for developers. When unsure try comparing your prices with items of similar development value and keep in mind that demand for some items might be smaller than for others.

#### What are the CRYENGINE Marketplace guidelines on asset pricing?

We don’t have strict guidelines for asset pricing, however please keep in mind that:

- The Marketplace should be a viable economy for content creators
- The content should be fairly priced from a buyer's point of view

You have full control over the pricing of your items, and it’s understandable that you want the time and skill you poured into its creation reflected in the price. Just keep in mind that setting a lower price might give a better incentive for more people to buy your assets and drive sales. There will also be opportunities to opt in to marketplace-wide promotions and timed sales; those will be communicated to you via vendor newsletter by the Marketplace team.

#### Who is responsible for supporting and keeping assets updated that have been uploaded to the Marketplace?

You as the vendor are responsible for supporting your item and you are responsible for maintaining future compatibility with the engine. Please keep in mind that your updated assets will also be available for download to those customers that have bought a previous version of the asset.

#### Who is responsible for testing Marketplace items?

You as the vendor are ultimately responsible for all quality assurance testing to ensure the best possible end user experience. If the asset is found to have errors and you have been contacted by Marketplace users or your customers, please submit the fix to the Marketplace team.

#### How do I update my content on the Marketplace?

In order to update your assets please email us at [marketplace@cryengine.com](mailto:marketplace@cryengine.com) with the following information:

- What the update is for (compatibility update, new or revised content, bug fixes, etc.)
- What specific changes were made
- If a change was made for a specific issue or customer complaint please let us know
- Any additional changes to the descriptions or images that also need updating
- Please see the submission guidelines for more assistance.
